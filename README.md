# tech-event-booth-geolocation-webapp
Webapp designed to gamify tech event booth attendance for employers. When an event attendee comes within specified radius of the booth, they can play the game. Supplying their twitter handle will compare them to employees at said company and return a bio of an employee with similar hobbies, interests, skillsets to the attendee. 

Coordinates are set to an incubator and tech event space in London:  51.5050° N, 0.0195° W and can be reset to each event's location in geolocator.js
